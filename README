Future Upgrades:
-Train own TTS model
-Run TTS on GPU with CUDA
-Get TTS to pause a little for ()
-Allow mixing of original video's audio with TTS generated audio
-Add slideshow format videos
-Add more acronyms
-Remove pause in TTS when text pages split mid-sentence. Could generate a setcond audio clip that reads both pages, and use the original audio to tell when to turn the page
-Stylize story title page to indicate title page vs body page
-Choose videos to use in lower half of screen that are snappier and pull in attention. Speed up Tom and Jerry clips?

Text Splitter Upgrades:
-Add () and ""
-Account for sets of multiple periods, especially ...
-Account for periods between () and ""
-Try testing multiple periods in a row
-Change () to have higher importance than .
-Test the below piece next!
Read title and body in 1 go each. For the body, take the total time of each text_page and get the ratio between it and the audio duration. Multiply this ratio by each individual text page's duration to get the duration to use for each text page.

Bug Fixes:
-Fix vertical lyric vid's text slides

Next Steps:
-Implement manual lyric splitter to determine page durations
-Auto Upload videos to YouTube and TikTok
-Generate Icon and Banner for YouTube and TikTok accounts
-Create YouTube and TikTok accounts
-Wikipedia Scraper or other sites
-Add image scraper from Google Images or elsewhere
-Integrate AI content generation instead of scraping Using Google Gemini
-Create webpage to serve as UI for process
