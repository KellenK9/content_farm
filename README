Installing can be done with:
pip install -r requirements
Then running the Magick installer and specifying a path for it
Then run the espeak installer and add to PATH
Then, before running commands run the line below:
Start-Process -FilePath "C:\Program Files\eSpeak NG\espeak-ng.exe"
Should I include all of this in the path? Even the .exe?
The term 'espeak-ng' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Looks like it's not added to the path correctly
